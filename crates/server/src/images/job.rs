//! One image job (spec image-model/05 §The queue, §Streaming): what a request
//! asks the image model for once its route has checked it, and the job
//! running it — in its turn, one call on the runner at a time, cancelled
//! between any two calls.
//!
//! A job makes its `n` images one after another over one condition prefix:
//! the prompt and the condition images encoded once, then for each image
//! `i` its own noise (`seed + i`), every denoising step, and the decode, the
//! image going out as a PNG as soon as it is made. The request reads the
//! job's [`JobEvent`]s off a channel and, by dropping it, cancels the job:
//! while it waits for its turn, or at the next call once it runs.
